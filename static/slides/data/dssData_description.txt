The dataset contains selected variables from 512 patients who were randomized to three different fluid Solutions for resuscitation in dengue shock syndrome.

Variables:
studyno           - Study Number
Fluid             - Randomised blinded fluid for initial resuscitation
age                   
sex               
day.ill           - day of illness at enrolment – earlier is often worse.     
wt                - weight  
adm.pp            - Admission Pulse Pressure – lower is worse         
resps             - Respiration rate at admission      
adm.bleed         - Any bleeding up to enrolment (none,mild,mod,severe) 
hct1              - Haematocrit at enrolment (higher is worse)
plat1             - Platelet at enrolment (lower is worse)
hospdays          - Total days in hospital     
hospital.bleeding - Any new bleeding after enrolment            
clinical_overload - Significant accumulation of fluid as a consequence of disease 
	            or treatment (yes, no)
outcome           - Survived or dead

In those with moderate severity at enrolment (PP >10) they could receive any of the 3 fluids, but in those that were more severe at presentation (PP <=10) they could only receive either dextran or starch.
